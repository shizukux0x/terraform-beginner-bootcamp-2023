    <h1>The Difference Between the Sun and the Moon!!</h1>
    <p>The Sun and the Moon are celestial bodies that have fascinated humanity for centuries. While they both appear in the sky and provide light, they are fundamentally different:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Nature:</strong> The Sun is a star, specifically a yellow dwarf star, at the center of our solar system. It primarily emits light and heat through nuclear fusion. In contrast, the Moon is Earth's natural satellite, reflecting the Sun's light to provide nighttime illumination.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Size:</strong> The Sun is incredibly massive, with a diameter approximately 109 times that of Earth. The Moon, on the other hand, is much smaller, with a diameter roughly 1/4th that of Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Light:</strong> The Sun emits its own light due to nuclear reactions, resulting in its intense brightness. The Moon, however, lacks its own light source and only shines because it reflects sunlight.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Temperature:</strong> The Sun's surface is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching millions of degrees Celsius. In contrast, the Moon's surface experiences significant temperature variations, from scorching hot during the day to extremely cold at night.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Impact on Earth:</strong> The Sun plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth by providing warmth and energy for photosynthesis. The Moon affects Earth through gravitational interactions, causing tides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These differences highlight the unique roles that the Sun and the Moon play in our solar system and their distinct characteristics.</p>
