    <h1>Oops! Something Went Banana 🍌</h1>
    <p>Looks like we took a wrong turn at the pineapple farm, and now we're in the middle of a fruity fiasco! 🍍🍉🥭</p>
    <p>Please don't split (like a banana peel) and leave us hanging. Our team of highly trained golden retrievers is working tirelessly to fix this fruity situation.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, you can try the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if your keyboard has a "Fruit" button and press it (just kidding, there's no such button).</li>
        <li>Take a moment to enjoy some actual bananas. They're potassium-packed and might help you stay calm during this fruity adventure.</li>
        <li>If all else fails, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the tropical vibes. 🌴🌞</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We apologize for any inconvenience this fruity error has caused. We promise to be back to our berry best in no time!</p>
